##  What should you do if you face or see such behavior?

### IF I FACE IT:
- I will tell the person to stop because I don’t like their behavior.  
- If I cannot handle it alone, I will talk to my manager or HR.  
- I will protect myself by taking the right steps.

### IF I SEE IT HAPPENING:
- I will ask the victim if they need my help.  
- I will tell the harasser to stop if I can.  
- If I can’t say anything at that moment, I will check on the victim later to offer help.  

#### *Examples:*
- If someone makes bad jokes about a co-worker, I will speak up.  
- If someone makes a woman uncomfortable, I will disagree with their behavior.
