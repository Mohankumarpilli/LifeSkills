# Browser Rendering

## What is rendering?
Rendering is a process used in web development that turns website code into the interactive pages users see when they visit a website. The term generally refers to the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. The process is completed by a rendering engine, the software used by a web browser to render a web page. Because of its close association with web browsers, rendering engines are commonly referred to as browser engines

## Steps in Browser Rendering
1. **HTML Parsing**:
   - The browser reads the HTML file to figure out the structure of the webpage.

2. **CSS Parsing**:
   - The browser reads the CSS file to understand how the page should look (colors, fonts, layout, etc.).

3. **Render Tree Construction**:
   - The browser combines the HTML and CSS to decide what will be shown on the screen.

4. **Layout Calculation**:
   - The browser calculates the size and position of everything on the page.

5. **Painting**:
   - The browser draws all the elements on the screen.

6. **Compositing**:
   - The browser puts everything together to display the final webpage.

## Tips to Improve Rendering
- Use small CSS and JavaScript files to make pages load faster.
- Use smaller images in modern formats like WebP.
- Avoid making too many changes to the webpage while it is loading.
